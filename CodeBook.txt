A script called run.analysis.R handles the data getting and cleaning. A first step is made to prepare the data for R. I choose to call this step data preperation.
After that step, each 5 step from the task description is made and can be seen below. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data preperation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the data set from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" and unzip it. 

2. Load all the data needed for the task, these are.
		
* features.txt
* activity_labels.txt
* test/X.test.txt
* test/y.test.txt		
* test/subject_test.txt
* train/X.test.txt
* train/y.test.txt		
* train/subject_test.txt	

For both the test and train data the y variable column is named "Activity" and the x column is named after the names in features.txt. The subjects column is named 
"subject". For both test and train data the y, subject and x data is merged with cbind() function. 
---------------------------------------------------
Task objectives
-----------------------------------------------------

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. The preperared train and test data is merged with rbind() function. The result is a data frame with 10299 rows and 563 columns.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  This was made with help of 
the grepl() function, finding every varible name containing either std or mean. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set This was made with with the factor() function and renaming every label to the right
one from the activity_labels.txt.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. This was made with function gsub(). 

* Acc -> "Accelerometer"
* BodyBody -> "Body"
* Mag -> "Magnitude"
* Gyro -> "Gyroscope"
* All names started with t, t -> "time"
* All names started with f, f -> "FastFourierTransform"
* () -> ""
* - -> ""
* Std -> "Std" 
* mean -> "Mean"
* freq -> "Frequency"

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Takes the mean for each variable for each subject and each activity. This with help of summarize_all function from dplyr package. The final data set
is writen into a text file "complete.txt".
